# About Me

## My Interests

I’m a college student studying cloud infrastructure. Some of my interests include audio, traveling when I can, and DIY projects. I also enjoy gaming and tinkering with computers to build custom setups. When I’m not studying or working on tech projects, you can usually find me in the garage working on a car or bike.
